<h2>init</h2>

<p>I'm rapidly becoming known as "that Emacs guy" in my office.</p>

<p>I'm very vocal about my love for this 43 year old piece of software, and (unsuccessfully) evangelize it amongst my peers. </p>

<p>Whenever one of my coworkers shows the smallest amount of interest in it, such as "Hey that presentation you gave with the code blocks, what was that in?", I'm prone to inundate them with additional reading materials and youtube videos about emacs and org-mode and why they should also consider using it to organize their life.</p>

<p>Naturally, they never ask me about it again.</p>

<p>Even with that, I still consider myself to be very junior as an Emacs user. There's still much I do not know, and even more that I do not know that I do not know.</p>

<p>With this post, I'm hoping to detail out my ever ongoing journey as an Emacs user. I'm hoping that this will prove to be useful to newcomers to Emacs, or that it will at least expand my currently very
small social network of Emacs users.</p>

<h2>history</h2>

<p>I've been interested in Emacs for about two years, and have been using it as my primary IDE
and beyond for roughly the past six months.</p>
