<h2 id="tl-dr-you-should-use-a-password-manager-and-two-factor-authentication">TL;DR - You should use a password manager and two factor authentication.</h2>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>Nowadays, an individual&rsquo;s online presence is dictated by many, many accounts.
Each account has some primary identifier - typically a username, or more commonly an email address.
Additionally, each account has its own password.
We&rsquo;ve been taught that these passwords must be <em>secure</em> - combinations of letters, number and symbols that would be difficult for someone to guess.</p>

<p>Relevant XKCD
<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is not reasonable for most people to remember dozens of unique passwords, especially if the passwords themselves are difficult to remember.
As a result, passwords invevitably get <em>re-used</em> across accounts.
Inherently, this isn&rsquo;t an issue, right? Only you know the password.</p>

<p><strong>Wrong.</strong></p>

<p><strong>TODO insert links to articles about breaches</strong></p>

<p>You should assume that at any point, a malicious third party could get access to one of your accounts.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been using the same email for various services, as well as re-using the same password, then you have an issue.
The attacker compromised one site, but got access to many of your accounts.</p>

<p>Diversifying the email addresses you use for registration is not practical, so it&rsquo;s much better to make sure every password you use is distinct.</p>

<p>How can we achieve this?</p>

<h2 id="diversifying-your-passwords">Diversifying your passwords</h2>

<h3 id="cipher">Cipher</h3>

<p>One option is to create a <em>cipher</em> - a pattern to generate passwords on a per site basis.</p>

<p>As a case study, let&rsquo;s create a Pokemon cipher to manage our passwords.</p>

<p>Our key will be the domain of the service - for example, &ldquo;facebook.com&rdquo;.
Our password formula could be as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">password = 
    First pokemon whose name starts with first letter of domain 
    + number of letters in domain 
    + &#34;!&#34; if domain length is even, else &#34;?&#34; 
    + First pokemon whose name starts with last letter of domain</pre></div>
<p>Using &ldquo;facebook.com&rdquo; as an example, the first pokemon whose name starts with F is &ldquo;Fearow&rdquo;, the domain has 8 letters in it, and the first pokemon whose name starts with &ldquo;k&rdquo; is &ldquo;Kadabra&rdquo;, so our password would be: <code>Fearow8!Kadabra</code>.</p>

<p>This approach would generally give us a unique password for each service, unless the domains have a common first letter, last letter and length.</p>

<p>The first problem of this approach is that everyone I&rsquo;ve spoken to who uses a cipher to encode their passwords <em>loves</em> to talk about how they use a cipher to encode their passwords.
This is tongue and cheek, but don&rsquo;t share your security implementation details ;)</p>

<p>The real problem with this approach is that you&rsquo;re introducing a <em>pattern</em> into your passwords.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that a few of your passwords using this structure get compromised in large scale breaches.
The compromised data that exists on the web looks like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">facebook Fearow8!Kadabra
twitter Tentacool7?Rattata
instagram Ivysaur9?Metapod</pre></div>
<p>Uh oh. All of a sudden, that cipher doesn&rsquo;t seem so secure anymore - anybody who notices the pattern and determines your cipher formula has gained access to <em>all of your passwords</em>.</p>

<p>There are methods you could take you try to make your cipher more robust and &ldquo;uncrackable&rdquo;, but the bad news is that anything <em>you</em> design will inherently be crackable.</p>

<p>Well, what if you didn&rsquo;t know any of your own passwords?</p>

<h3 id="password-manager">Password Manager</h3>

<p>A <em>password manager</em> is a piece of software you can use to store all of your passwords.</p>

<p><strong>ALARM BELLS, car tires screeching, screams in the distance</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, you want me to put all of my passwords into one location? That seems <em>wildly</em> insecure. What happens if an attacker gets access to my vault?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hear me out, I promise that this is actually the most secure way you could manage your passwords as an average tech savvy citizen.</p>

<p>Using a password manager, you can generate random passwords for every account you create. When you visit those websites, rather than typing in the password manually, you can
paste it directly from the password manager.</p>

<p>What a win, right? Our password diversification problem is solved - we have a unique password per service, so if any of those become compromised, you can sleep at night knowing that none of your <em>other</em> accounts have been compromised.</p>

<p>The downside of this approach is that additional mental load is added when trying to log onto a service, especially on mobile. When prompted for a password, you must switch to your manager, enter the password for that, traverse to the account password you need, copy it, switch back to the site, and paste it in. I hear you, that&rsquo;s a pain, but in my eyes it&rsquo;s worth it for the security.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re not quite done talking about password managers. There are two things you need to keep in mind: your master password must be easily memorizable but very secure, and you <em>must</em> enable two factor authentication on it.</p>
