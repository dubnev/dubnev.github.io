      <description>init I&amp;rsquo;m rapidly becoming known as &amp;ldquo;that Emacs guy&amp;rdquo; in my office.
I&amp;rsquo;m very vocal about my love for this ~35 year old piece of software, and (unsuccessfully) evangelize it amongst my peers.
Whenever one of my coworkers shows the smallest amount of interest in it, such as &amp;ldquo;Hey that presentation you gave with the code blocks, what was that in?&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s off to the races. I&amp;rsquo;m prone to inundate them with additional reading materials and youtube videos about emacs and org-mode and why they should also consider using it to organize their life.</description>
