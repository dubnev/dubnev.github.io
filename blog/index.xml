      <description>Thesis  What does it mean to complete a &amp;#34;speedrun&amp;#34; of a video game? Abstractly, completing a &amp;#34;speedrun&amp;#34; of a game is to satisfy some predetermined set of dependencies as quickly as possible while adhering to a predetermined set of restrictions.
 This post will explore the nature of these sets of &amp;#34;dependencies&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;restrictions&amp;#34; that the community establishes for their games.
  The Definition of Completion can be Subjective  Let&amp;#39;s take a step back: what does it mean to beat a game?</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m prone to inundate them with additional reading materials and youtube videos about emacs and org-mode and why they should also consider using it to organize their life.</description>

Additionally, each account has its own password. We&amp;rsquo;ve been taught that these passwords must be secure - combinations of letters, number and symbols that would be difficult for someone to guess.</description>
